# dice-stats

My solution for Chapter 5 Exercise 3 of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.

Implementation notes: At the time I did this exercise, I implemented it in a way that I would now consider to be... not ideal. 
Rather than rewriting it now, I am choosing to leave it as is to demonstrate my progression. 
The most concerning issues with it are that 1) the main function could be vastly simplified by calling the print statements in a for-loop
and 2) the countRollsToTally should NOT implement a dice-rolling functionality, but should call PairOfDice.roll().

Problem Descripton:
This problem uses the PairOfDice class from Exercise 5.1 and the StatCalc class from Exercise 5.2.
The program in Exercise 4.4 performs the experiment of counting how many times a
pair of dice is rolled before a given total comes up. It repeats this experiment 10000 times
and then reports the average number of rolls. It does this whole process for each possible
total (2, 3, . . . , 12).
Redo that exercise. But instead of just reporting the average number of rolls, you
should also report the standard deviation and the maximum number of rolls. Use a
PairOfDice object to represent the dice. Use a StatCalc object to compute the statistics.
(You’ll need a new StatCalc object for each possible total, 2, 3, . . . , 12. You can use a
new pair of dice if you want, but it’s not required.)
